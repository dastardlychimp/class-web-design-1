    My name is Darien, and I created First Capture for my intro to web design class at UVU. The goal of First Capture is to explain some of the basics in photography. I took a few photography classes in High School and I have been doing web development for several years. I'm a #[em very] amateur photographer, but hopefully you can learn something if you are new to photography.
