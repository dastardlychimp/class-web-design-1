    "aperture": "The opening through which light travells. Controlled by f-stops. A smaller f-number is a larger opening and more light; a larger f-stop is a smaller opening and less light. Affects depth of field.",
    "depth of field": "",
    "exposure": "The amount of light captured. Goverened by aperture, shutter speed, and ISO",
    "exposure-value": "",
    "f-number": "The ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the entrance. If you double the f-number, you capture 4x the light.",
    "f-stop": "Marked by an f-number, measures a doubling or halving of light when changed by &radic;2. f/2.8 to f/2 will halve the light. f/2.8 to f/4 will double the light. The typical pattern: f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, f/32, f/45, f/64, f/90, f/128",
    "image-sensor": "",
    "ISO": "Named after the International Organization for Standardization, ISO is the speed or sensitivity of the film. When the ISO is doubled the light captured is doubled. A Lower ISO has finer grain, and a higher ISO will have more noise.",
    "shutter": "A curtain, when opened, allows light to pass to the image sensor.",
    "shutter speed": "Specifies how long the shutter will remain open when an image is taken. A fast shutter speed will let in less light; a slower shutter speed will let in more light. If you change your shutter speed from 1/120 to 1/30 you are increasing the light captured by 4x."
